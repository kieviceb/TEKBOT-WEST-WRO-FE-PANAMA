# Future Engineers Challenge Overview

The **WRO 2025 Future Engineers challenge** challenges teams to design and build a fully autonomous robot capable of navigating a dynamic and randomized racetrack. Using a combination of sensors, computer vision, and advanced control algorithms, the robot must adapt to changing obstacles, follow predefined driving rules, and demonstrate precise maneuvering skills.

### 📌 Competition Format

- **🏁 Open Challenge:**  
  The robot must complete **three (3) laps** around a track where obstacles and track elements are randomly placed, requiring real-time adaptation.

- **🚦 Obstacle Challenge:**  
  The robot must detect and respond correctly to randomly positioned colored markers:  
  - 🟥 **Red signs** → Robot must drive on the right side of the lane.  
  - 🟩 **Green signs** → Robot must drive on the left side of the lane.

  After completing the laps, the robot must find a designated parking zone and perform a precise **parallel parking maneuver** within a confined space, adding an additional technical challenge.

### 📑 Documentation Requirements

Each team is required to maintain a **public GitHub repository** documenting their engineering design process, technical decisions, robot design, and source code. This encourages transparency, collaboration, and learning within the robotics community.

### 🏆 Scoring & Evaluation

Teams are evaluated based on their robot’s **accuracy**, **speed**, and the quality of their **technical documentation**. Points are awarded to teams that effectively balance performance, adaptability to randomized conditions, and innovation in their approach. This challenge promotes not only technical skills in robotics and programming but also problem-solving, teamwork, and creative engineering.

## ⚙️ Mobility Management

Our robot's mobility system is divided into two main components: **movement** and **steering**.

### Movement
The robot uses a **DC motor** mounted at the rear, connected to a **shared rear axle** via a mechanical linkage. This ensures both rear wheels rotate together, complying with WRO rules. The motor shaft (D-shaft) is securely coupled to the axle for efficient torque transfer.

The motor is controlled by an **L298N motor driver**, which is connected directly to the **Raspberry Pi**. This allows the Pi to manage motor speed and direction based on real-time vision processing.

### Steering
For steering, we use the **MG996R metal gear servo motor**, known for its high torque and precision. The robot employs an **Ackermann steering system**, included in the Funduino kit, which mimics real vehicle steering geometry for smoother and more accurate turns.

The **Arduino Nano RP2040** receives steering commands from the Raspberry Pi and controls the servo motor accordingly.

## 🔋 Power Management

Our robot uses a dual power system to efficiently manage energy distribution:

- A **power bank** supplies power to the **Raspberry Pi**, the **Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 webcam**, and the **DC motor** (via the L298N driver). This ensures stable voltage and current for the SBC (Single Board Computer) and high-power components.
  
- A set of **3.7V Flat Top Lithium Rechargeable Batteries** powers the **Arduino Nano RP2040** and the **MG996R servo motor**. This separation helps prevent voltage drops and ensures reliable operation of the control and actuation systems.

We are planning to replace the power bank with the **Geekworm Raspberry Pi Wide Input Voltage Power Management Module**, which will allow us to:

- Power the Raspberry Pi and camera directly from the 3.7V lithium batteries.
- Provide regulated and protected power delivery to the SBC.
- Reduce weight and improve cable management by eliminating the external power bank.

This upgrade will result in a more compact, efficient, and reliable power system.

## 👁️ Sense and Object Detection

Our robot uses **computer vision** to perceive its environment and make autonomous decisions.

### Vision System
We use the **Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000** webcam in combination with **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)**, a powerful toolkit for real-time image processing. All image processing is handled on the **Raspberry Pi**, which interprets the camera feed and:

- Sends **steering commands** to the **Arduino Nano RP2040**, which controls the MG996R servo motor.
- Directly controls the **DC motor** through the **L298N motor driver**.

This setup enables the robot to:

- Detect and avoid **black walls** on the track.
- Identify and avoid **obstacles**, including **red and green blocks**.
- Recognize the **magenta parking spot** and perform parking maneuvers.
- Count **orange and blue lines** on the mat to track laps (3 total), ensuring compliance with lap-counting requirements.
