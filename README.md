# ⚙️ Mobility Management

Our robot's mobility system is divided into two main components: **movement** and **steering**.

### Movement
The robot uses a **DC motor** mounted at the rear, connected to a **shared rear axle** via a mechanical linkage. This ensures both rear wheels rotate together, complying with WRO rules. The motor shaft (D-shaft) is securely coupled to the axle for efficient torque transfer.

The motor is controlled by an **L298N motor driver**, which is connected directly to the **Raspberry Pi**. This allows the Pi to manage motor speed and direction based on real-time vision processing.

### Steering
For steering, we use the **MG996R metal gear servo motor**, known for its high torque and precision. The robot employs an **Ackermann steering system**, included in the Funduino kit, which mimics real vehicle steering geometry for smoother and more accurate turns.

The **Arduino Nano RP2040** receives steering commands from the Raspberry Pi and controls the servo motor accordingly.

# 🔋 Power Management

Our robot uses a well-organized power system to ensure stable and efficient energy distribution:

- A **power bank** supplies power to both the **Raspberry Pi** and the **Arduino Nano RP2040**, providing stable voltage and current to the main computing units.

- The **MG996R servo motor** is powered by the **5 volts** output from the **Raspberry Pi**, ensuring synchronized control and stable operation.

- The **Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 webcam** connects to the **Raspberry Pi** via **USB**, receiving data and power directly through this interface.

- The **DC motor** is powered by **three STEREN Li-ion 2800 mAh rechargeable batteries** delivering **12 volts** through the **L298N driver**, allowing it to handle higher voltages and currents safely.

We are planning to upgrade the system by replacing the power bank with the **Geekworm Raspberry Pi Wide Input Voltage Power Management Module**, which will:

- Allow powering the Raspberry Pi and camera directly from lithium batteries with regulated voltage.
- Provide protected and reliable power delivery to all connected components.
- Help reduce overall weight and simplify cable management by removing the external power bank.

This upgrade aims to create a more compact, efficient, and reliable power system for the robot.

# 📡 Robot Communication

Our robot implements a structured communication system between its two core processing units to ensure synchronized and reliable operation:

- The **Raspberry Pi** (SBC – Single Board Computer) acts as the **master**. It is responsible for high-level tasks such as image processing, object detection, strategy decision-making, and general system coordination.

- The **Arduino Nano RP2040** (SBM – Secondary Board Microcontroller) acts as the **slave**. It is dedicated to real-time control of low-level hardware components, such as driving the servo motor and interpreting incoming instructions from the master.

### 🔁 Serial Communication

The two boards communicate via a **UART (Serial) interface** using the following configuration:

- **Raspberry Pi TX (GPIO 14)** → **Arduino RX (pin 1)**  
- **Raspberry Pi RX (GPIO 15)** ← **Arduino TX (pin 0)**

This full-duplex serial link enables:

- The **Raspberry Pi (master)** to send instructions like servo angles or movement triggers based on camera input.
- The **Arduino (slave)** to receive commands and execute precise control over hardware.
- **Optional feedback**: The Arduino can also send status messages or sensor feedback back to the Raspberry Pi when necessary.

This master-slave architecture promotes:

- **Modularity**, by separating high-level logic and low-level control.
- **Responsiveness**, with real-time actions handled by the microcontroller.
- **Scalability**, allowing for future hardware expansions without major rewrites.

The system is optimized for efficiency and robustness in fast-paced robotic challenges.

# 👁️ Sense and Object Detection

Our robot uses **computer vision** to perceive its environment and make autonomous decisions.

### Vision System
We use the **Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000** webcam in combination with **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)**, a powerful toolkit for real-time image processing. All image processing is handled on the **Raspberry Pi**, which interprets the camera feed and:

- Sends **steering commands** to the **Arduino Nano RP2040**, which controls the MG996R servo motor.
- Directly controls the **DC motor** through the **L298N motor driver**.

This setup enables the robot to:

- Detect and avoid **black walls** on the track.
- Identify and avoid **obstacles**, including **red and green blocks**.
- Recognize the **magenta parking spot** and perform parking maneuvers.
- Count **orange and blue lines** on the mat to track laps (12 sets of lines total), ensuring compliance with lap-counting requirements.


# ⚔️ Challenge Strategies

## Open Challenge Strategy

The Open Challenge focuses on detecting colored lines—specifically **orange** and **blue**—on the floor and reacting by steering the robot accordingly:

- The camera captures a Region of Interest (ROI) near the floor to detect these colored lines.
- HSV color filtering isolates orange and blue colors in the ROI.
- When an orange line is detected, the robot commands the servo to turn **120° to the right** and temporarily increases motor speed.
- When a blue line is detected, the robot commands the servo to turn **58° to the left** and also increases motor speed.
- If no colored line is detected, the servo centers at **90°**, and the robot moves at a default speed.
- Turns last for a fixed duration (~1.3 seconds), after which the servo returns to center and speed reduces to default.
- Visual feedback is provided via OpenCV windows showing the camera feed and detected masks.
- The motor is continuously driven forward except when stopping is needed.
- This strategy allows the robot to smoothly follow colored paths by combining real-time color detection with timed servo steering commands.

## Obstacle Challenge Strategy

The Obstacle Challenge code relies on detecting colored blocks—**red** and **green**—using the camera, and responding with precise servo movements to avoid collisions:

- The camera captures a region (ROI) where colored blocks appear.
- HSV filtering identifies red and green blocks.
- The program calculates the position (center X coordinate) and size (pixel area) of these blocks.
- When a red block is detected with enough size, the robot initiates a **right turn** by commanding the servo to angle **120°**.
- When a green block is detected, it initiates a **left turn** with servo angle **58°**.
- The robot **continues to turn until each block moves past a predefined horizontal limit** (an X-coordinate on the frame), ensuring the block is completely avoided before resuming a straight path.

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b70ce4a-0ba3-4e91-924a-d9df1eb91ae7" alt="Example image" width="300" />
</div>
- Turning state (`girando`) tracks if the robot is currently turning to prevent conflicting commands.           
- The robot uses a black line detection ROI to keep track and assist navigation while turning.
- Orange lines are detected to count how many have been crossed; the robot stops after detecting **12** orange lines, indicating the end of the course.
- The servo command is sent as an angle string to the Arduino, which moves the servo accordingly.
- The motor moves forward continuously unless stopped by the orange line count condition.
- The system uses visual markers and debug prints for easy monitoring.
- At the moment of parking it will identify the Magente parking lot and maneuver to do a parallel park.

This obstacle avoidance strategy combines color-based object detection with line following and a servo-actuated steering system to navigate safely and complete the obstacle course.
